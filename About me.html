             <p>interesse is mechanical things building them and programming them though I like building them more then I program them.
              My hobby is Gaming and Comic books and anime. I don’t really do that many activities, but I don’t mind them I like to be active but don’t really am the athletic type of person.
               I really just like the adrenalin of the game and like playing with people though I like the more brutal sport than the soft sports though some of them are all right
              </p>
